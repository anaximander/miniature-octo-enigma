# Technical Challenge: Bike Share Data Mapping
## TODO
* [ ] Finish initial dev setup
* [ ] Clean up README and add links
* [ ] Create GitHub repo
* [ ] Add design/notes doc (markdown)

## Task Overview
MAPC Digital wants to help communities better take advantage of bike share open data made available by Bluebikes on the Bluebikes system data page.

Your assignment is to create a simple website that will enable nontechnical transportation advocates and planners to explore the bluebikes data relevant to a geography of interest. The website should allow the user to enter a municipality via a text box or drop down menu and view relevant data for that municipality as summary metrics, as well as on a map.

To do this, you will need to utilize Bluebikes trip history data and station location data and you may utilize the bluebikes real-time General Bikeshare Feed Specification “GBFS” data (Bluebikes GBFS feed here, GBFS documentation here). You may want or need to supplement these data sources with other open data on the Bluebikes system data page or found elsewhere.

### Requirements
#### Must Have
* The user must be able to visit the website and enter a municipality name into a textbox and/or dropdown menu.
* The website must display geospatial data and metrics from the Bluebike system data filtered to that municipality on a map and/or dashboard.

#### Should Have
* Data results should display showing a map of Bluebike stations in that municipality (a CSV containing Bluebike station locations can be found here).
* The user should be able to view summary tripinformation for their community. This may include information for specific stations (e.g. number of trips with origin or destination at a specific station) and/or may include summary information for the entire municipality
(e.g. number of trips with origin or destination in the municipality).
  * Trip metrics can be derived from one or more Bluebike trip data CSVs
  * This information may be displayed in a number of ways at the discretion of the applicant, such as as a tool tip on the map, or as a separate “dashboard” displayed beside the map.

#### Could Have / Nice to Have
* Bonus points will also be given for creative incorporation of the Bluebikes GBFS real time data feed.

Finally, we encourage you to get creative and draw inspiration from the 2017 Bluebikes data challenge and/or “Bluebikes in 2020” data story vizualization.

#### Additional Guidelines
You should use git to track your work in a (public GitHub) repo that is accessible to us. We recommend hosting your solution on GitHub pages or another web server so we can view the final result.

You may document any assumptions you make in your commit messages or code comments.

Your solution will be evaluated on the following criteria:
* Code quality / clarity
* Performance
* UX/UI design and overall creativity

### Due date and presentation:
Please work with HR to schedule a final interview at which you will present your solution/website.

Candidates are expected to complete the challenge at least 48 hours prior to the final interview so that the MAPC interview committee has time to review. We appreciate that this is unpaid work, and want to be respectful of candidates time. We anticipate candidates will spend 3-6 hours on this challenge.

If you run into difficulty or have questions please feel free to contact digital@mapc.org
